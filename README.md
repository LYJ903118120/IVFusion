# An infrared and visible image fusion method based on multi-scale transformation and norm optimization
Information Fusion.,2021,
## Note
In 'test.m' file, you will find how to run these codes.
## Highlights
⑴A new infrared and visible image fusion method was proposed. 

⑵A pre-fusion method was proposed for base layer fusion. 

⑶Image structure similarity and norm optimization were firstly used for detail layer fusion. 

⑷Our method can outperform the compared methods in high-brightness scenes.

⑸Our method facilitates target detection, recognition, and tracking for intelligent systems.
